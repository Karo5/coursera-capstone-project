The best location for him will be place that is maximum similar with his Moscow apartment neighborhoods (Marino - district of South-Eastern Administrative region of the federal city of Moscow).\n",

    "1. Explore the neighborhoods of south of Moscow and all neighborhoods of Yerevan (Foursquare API)\n",

    "3. With k-means clustering method divide explored areas to 5 clusters,\n",

    "4. Find region in Yerevan city that includes in the same cluster with Moscow apartment of our client."
